# Tower-Defence-Experiment

### This respository is for educational and training purposes.

The main reason for creating this repository is to make very simple tower defence game with only one level for now. For this tower defence experiment I use SFML and OpenGL library for graphics, audio, shaders, textures and others. Any advices for better tower defence game are very appreciated and welcomed.
